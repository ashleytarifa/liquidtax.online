                <p>MoonTalk is a website where you share stories and rumors about Moonlight Camp<br><br>
                to give some context, this site is part of an RPG that i'm participating in with some friends, i decided to create the entire website from scratch because i hadn't programmed in a while, and im happy with the result :)<br>
                notice that the entire website is in brazilian portuguese, in case you don't understand anything that is written on it<br>
                website is now discontinued because the rpg ended lol</p>
