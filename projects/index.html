            <h3>purrgatory (pt-br translation)</h3>
            <p>purrgatory was the first game i played when i created my steam account, so this game has an emotional
              value for me
              one day (in like 2023) the dev (niv) was looking for volunteer translators to translate his game, i've
              never translated a game before, but i saw an opportunity at that time and it worked! the game is on fully
              ptbr now, and i intend to translate other games later on, who knows?</p>

            <p>Cellbit Archive is a fan-made channel meant to preserve old videos from CellBits — especially those that were removed or made private over time<br><br>
              The goal is to keep a little piece of history alive for those who miss it or are curious about it. It's just a small memory corner from someone who grew up watching and wanted to keep a bit of that close</p>
